This is simple note taking app using react.js

I learn about crypto built-in function to use random keys and ids in react.js. I manage delete operation via random
ids. I use file structure I learnt and it made things easier for me. More complex apps it is good to use file 
structure otherwise your app will messed up. I have done to do app and it has bad structure and complex code
I should fix it.
